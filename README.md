# Project Overview:


This project is a dynamic, real-time weather dashboard built using Power BI. The goal was to demonstrate skills in API data ingestion, data transformation, data modeling, and interactive data visualization. The dashboard provides key weather metrics and a 7-day forecast for major cities, with data automatically refreshing to show current conditions.

### Key Features:

* Real-Time Data: The dashboard retrieves live weather data from an external weather API.

* 7-Day Forecast: Includes a visual forecast of temperature and precipitation for the upcoming week.

* Key Weather Metrics: Displays essential metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and air quality.

* Geographic Insights: Provides an at-a-glance comparison of weather in key cities like Amsterdam, Leiden , Utrecht and Zoetermeer.



### Tools and Technologies Used:

* Power BI: For data modeling, transformation, and dashboard creation.

* Weather API: For sourcing real-time and forecast weather data.

* Power Query: To connect to the API, clean, and transform the raw data.

* DAX â€“ Conditional formatting and KPI calculations



### Project Steps:

 * **1 Data Sourcing:** Connected to a live weather API to retrieve current weather and forecast data in a JSON format.

 * **2 Data Transformation:** Used Power Query to parse the JSON data, unnest records, and transform columns into a clean, structured table.

 * **3 Data Modeling:** Established relationships between the main data tables to ensure a cohesive data model for accurate analysis.

 * **4 Dashboard Design:** Created an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard using various charts (line charts, bar charts) and cards to display key weather metrics.



### Key Insights & Visualizations:

 * **Live Weather Overview:** A central display showing the current temperature, conditions, and last updated time.

 * **7-Day Forecast:** A bar chart visualizing daily high/low temperatures and a separate chart for precipitation forecasts.

 * **Comparative Analysis:** A simple card view to compare the current weather of multiple cities.

 * **Air Quality Index (AQI):** A visual breakdown of key pollutants to provide an air quality score.
